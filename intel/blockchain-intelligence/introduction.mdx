### **What is the Blockchain Intelligence Service?**

The Blockchain Intelligence Service is a robust API designed to provide real-time information on updates related to various blockchain nodes. This service is essential for DevOps engineers, blockchain developers, and system administrators who need to keep track of changes in node configurations, software versions, and other critical parameters.

Key Features:

- Real-time updates on node changes
- Detailed information including version, commit hash, release date, and more
- Stay up to date on Discord, Telegram and Slack announcements from various chains.
- Support for multiple blockchain networks
- Alert notifications via Slack, PagerDuty, Telegram, Webhook, etc

You will need an enterprise license to generate an API key. Contact support@scale3labs.com for any questions.

## **Querying for Node Updates**

### **Making a Request**

To query for the latest node updates for a specific chain, you can make a GET request to the following endpoint:

```bash
GET https://web-backend.scale3production.com/node_updates/?chain=nameOfChain
```

### **Headers**

- **`x-api-key`**: Your API key
- **`x-user-agent`**: `s3l-web-client`

### **Query Parameters**

- **`chain`**: The blockchain network you are interested in (e.g., **`btc`**, **`eth`**).
- **`client`**: The specific client software you are interested in (e.g., **`geth`**, **`sui`**).

### Sample Request

```bash
curl --location "https://web-backend.scale3production.com/node_updates?chain=eth&client=geth" \
--header 'x-api-key: afada-95fd-4a65-ab8a-adadada' --header 'x-user-agent: s3l-web-client'
```

Replace your-api-key-here with the API key you generated. This example queries updates for the Bitcoin (BTC) chain. You can replace btc with other supported chains like eth for Ethereum or sol for Solana.

### Response

The API will return a JSON object containing an array of node updates.
