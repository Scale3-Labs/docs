### Utilizing Query Parameters with GET Network Feed

Similar to our 'GET Node Updates' endpoint, the 'GET Network Feed' also supports various query parameters for advanced search capabilities. For a detailed guide on using query parameters, please refer to the [GET Node Updates documentation](https://scale3labs.com/docs/api-integration/node-updates/GET-node-updates). Below are specific examples tailored for the 'GET Network Feed' endpoint.

#### Examples of Query Parameters for Network Feed

1. **Filtering by Label and Chain:**
   Retrieve network feeds tagged as 'announcement' for the 'Ethereum' chain.
   ```http
   GET /network-feed?labels=announcement&chain=eth

2. **Pagination and Network Specific Feed:**
Get the second page of feeds for the 'mainnet' network, showing 5 records per page.
    ```http
    GET /network-feed?network=mainnet&page=2&page_size=5
