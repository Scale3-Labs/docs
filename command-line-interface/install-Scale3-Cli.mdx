title: Install Scale3 CLI
---

To install Scale3 CLI you can either find your previous install directory or start by downloading the install script. For this exercise, we walk through downloading the script.

- SSH in to the node you want to install the cli on.
- Download the install script and change the permissions

```bash
curl -L -G --fail "https://web-backend.scale3production.com/cli/binary" | tar -xz
chmod a+x uninstallcli.sh
```

- Run the install script

```bash
./installcli.sh -k <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

- This completes the installation of the Scale3 CLI on your node. You can see [Monitoring](/nodepilot/linking-a-node) section to setup monitoring and [Logging](/logging/getting-started) section to setup logging
