ðŸš§ title: Uninstall Scale3 CLI
---

To uninstall Scale3 CLI you can either find your previous install directory or start by downloading the uninstall script. For this exercise, we walk through downloading the script.

- SSH in to the node you want to uninstall the node from.
- Download the uninstall script and change the permissions

```bash
curl -L -G --fail "https://web-backend.scale3production.com/cli/binary" | tar -xz
chmod a+x uninstallcli.sh
```

- Run the uninstall script and remove both Grafana Agent and Vector agent 

```bash
./uninstallcli.sh --component all
```

- If you prefer to only remove Grafana you can run 

```bash
./uninstallcli.sh --component grafana
```

- To only remove Vector you can run 

```bash
./uninstallcli.sh --component vector
```

- This completes the removal of the Scale3 CLI from your node. You can follow the onboarding [steps](https://scale3labs.com/docs/monitoring/introduction) to monitor your node again.
