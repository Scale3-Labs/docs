<Accordion title="How long does it take to setup Logging?">
	Less than 3 minutes to onboard a node with Scale3 CLI. If you still need help or support with bulk onboarding, we are happy to do it for you. Just reach out to us on our discord or email us at support@scale3labs.com.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does Scale3 plug into my Validator's logs?">
	The Scale3 CLI is a wrapper around the popular monitoring agent, Grafana and logging agent, Vector. If you already have the Vector Agent installed, you just need to tweak the configuration to point to Scale3.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How secure is the Scale3 CLI?">
	Since we use the best in class and battle tested Grafana Agent and Vector Agent, you can be assured that your node is secure. We do NOT install any other proprietary agents on your nodes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the retention and storage policy for logging?">
	We currently offer a 3 day retention policy and a 20GB storage policy. If you hit the 20GB cap, we will automatically prune logs beyond 1 hour. If you need more retention or storage, please reach out to us through our live chat or email us at support@scale3labs.com.
