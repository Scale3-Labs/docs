<Accordion title="SUI Helper fails at download binary stage">
  ![Node Checker Results](/images/sui-node-checker-download-binary-failed.png)

The download binary can be due to various reasons:

1. Server does not have access to internet. You can try accessing any public endpoint using `curl` or
   `ping` command like `bash ping 8.8.8.8 `
2. The linux user does not have access to selected download path, so make sure the path inserted at Download Binary page is valid and accessible by your user.
3. Scale3Lab's binary repo
   does not have required release version for SUI. We generally build many
   versions, but it's possible that each individual have their custom
   requirements. If this is the case, you may just proceed with any common
   release tag and continue with the flow and later just before starting the
   linux service abort the tool and manually replace your desired sui-node binary
   with the one which was downloaded.

<Accordion title='How to start/restart sui-node?'>
    Assuming you have setup your SUI fullnode or validator using SUI Helper.

    To **start** a sui-node process run the following command
    ```bash
    sudo service sui-node start
    ```

    To **restart** sui-node process run
    ```bash
    sudo service sui-node restart
    ```

<Accordion title='How to check if my SUI node is syncing?'>
    You can check if your node is syncing blocks in any of the following ways.

    1. Using SUI Node Checker
        Use this tool https://www.scale3labs.com/check/sui. Run the check atleast twice with an interval of minimum 10 seconds and observe your node block height, it should increase.

    2. Run this command on your SUI node server
        ```bash
        curl --location --request POST http://localhost:9000 \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data-raw '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"sui_getTotalTransactionBlocks","id":1}'
        ```
        Output should be something like:
        ```json
        {"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"23446624","id":1}
        ```
        Run this command multiple times, if your node is syncing fine you should notice number in `result` block going up.

    3. Onboard your node on Scale3Labs Autopilot
        To observe syncing trend on your node, the best way to do is by onboarding your node on https://www.scale3labs.com/#autopilot.

<Accordion title='My SUI node is not syncing, what should I do?'>
    If you have just setup a new node and its not syncing, this could mostly be due to your node unable to find peers. Follow the steps to add peers to your SUI node config file.
    - cd into directory where you have `fullnode.yaml` or `validator.yaml` file (If you do not know where the file is, check the FAQ for how to find config file). For most of the scenarios it's by running
        ```bash
        cd ~/sui/
        ```
    - add peers to the list. This list is taken from [here](https://github.com/testnet-pride/Node-manuals/blob/main/Testnets/Sui/guidePT.md#if-your-node-is-not-syncing-try-adding-peers-into-p2p-config).
    <Warning>
        This peer list is only for testnet
    </Warning>

```bash
sudo tee -a fullnode.yaml << END
p2p-config:
  seed-peers:
    - address: "/dns/sui-rpc-pt.testnet-pride.com/udp/8084"
    - address: "/dns/sui-rpc-pt2.testnet-pride.com/udp/8084"
    - address: "/dns/sui-rpc-testnet.bartestnet.com/udp/8084"
    - address: "/ip4/38.242.197.20/udp/8080"
    - address: "/ip4/178.18.250.62/udp/8080"
    - address: "/ip4/162.55.84.47/udp/8084"
    - address: "/dns/wave-3.testnet.n1stake.com/udp/8084"
END
```

- Once added, restart the sui-node process by running
  ```bash
  sudo service sui-node restart
  ```

<Accordion title='How to check SUI version?'>
    1. Check SUI version by running binary. First `cd` to the path where you have your sui-node binary
        ```bash
            ./sui-node --version
        ```
    2. By making the following API call. this requires `jq` to be installed.
        <Info>
            If you have a different custom setup, make sure to change **localhost** and **port** to your desired values.
        </Info>
        ```bash
            curl --location --request POST http://localhost:9000 \
                --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                --data-raw '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"rpc.discover","id":1}' | jq '.result.info.version'
        ```
    3. If you have already onboarded your node on [Scale3 Autopilot](https://www.scale3labs.com/#autopilot), you can check it on metrics dashboard.

<Accordion title='Where is my Node config file?'>
    Config file for fullnode is `fullnode.yaml` whereas for validators its `validator.yaml`.
    
    Generally, they are located at
    ```bash
        cd ~/sui/
    ```
    But if you have used different folder path during the setup and you don't recall it now, you can find the config file by checking the `sui-node` linux service.
    ```bash
        cat /etc/systemd/system/sui-node.service | grep 'ExecStart'
    ```
    The output of above command will have `--config-path` value, that's the file path of your config file.

<Accordion title='sui-node process is failing, how do I check logs?'>
    To check logs for sui-node service you can run the following command.
    ```bash
        journalctl -fu sui-node
    ```
