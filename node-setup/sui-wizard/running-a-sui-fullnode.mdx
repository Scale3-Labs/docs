title: Running A Sui FullNode
description: "Steps to setup a Sui fullnode on devnet/testnet"
---

[Sui Wizard](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/sui-node-helper) makes life easy for setting up a fullnode for `mainnet`, `testnet` or `devnet`.

You can follow the doc or check out the medium [blog](https://medium.com/@scale3/sui-wizard-node-management-simplified-b6a7395745e5).

## System Requirements

As per the [Sui documentation](https://docs.sui.io/build/fullnode#hardware-requirements), the recommended minimum hardware requirements are as follows:

- CPUs: 8 physical cores / 16 vCPUs
- RAM: 128 GB
- Storage (SSD): 2 TB NVMe drive

## Steps to Setup a Fullnode

<Tip>
  In this walkthough we are going to setup a fullnode for `Mainnet`, but the
  steps remain same for other Sui networks.
</Tip>

### Step 1: Connect to the Server

To connect to your server, use SSH or RDP to access the server terminal, allowing you to run commands directly.

### Step 2: Download and Run Sui Wizard

- Download the script

  ```bash
  curl --fail --location --output helper.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Scale3-Labs/sui-node-helper/master/helper.sh
  ```

- Give executable permissions

  ```bash
  chmod +x helper.sh
  ```

- Run the script

  <Note>
    _If the script prompts to install dependencies, type 'y' to install them._
  </Note>

  ```bash
  ./helper.sh
  ```

### Step 3: Configure the server for running Sui Mainnet Fullnode

- Once you are on the welcome screen, follow the screenshots below for the steps.
  Press `Yes`

- Read the instructions and press `Yes` to continue.

- Since we are setting up a Fullnode, we will select the **RPC Full Node** option.

- Select **Setup Fullnode From Scratch**

- For the next screen, you are asked to choose Sui network, we will choose **Mainnet**.
  ![Sui Wizard Network Choice](/node-setup/sui-wizard/assets/sui-wizard-network-choice.png)

- On the next page there are two fields, you can keep it default.

1.  Release Version or hash

    This is the `sui-node` version that has to be installed. The values can be either:

    - **Github release**: sui-v1.0.0, testnet-1.0.0
    - **Branch**: mainnet, testnet, or devnet
    - **Commit Hash**: ae1212baf8f0837e25926d941db3d26a61c1bea2, c525ba6489261ff6db65e87bf9a3fdda0a6c7be3

    > Avoid using commit hash as much as possible, using **Github Release is the easiest and recommended option**.

2.  Absolute folder for configs

    Path to the folder where you want to store all your Sui node configs. Configs include `fullnode.yaml`, binaries, etc.

    <Tip>Make sure to remember this path for updating your node in future.</Tip>

    ![Sui Wizard Release Input Window](/node-setup/sui-wizard/assets/sui-wizard-release-input-window.png)

    After pressing `OK` or hitting enter/return, the download of the Sui binary will start, and once it's successfully downloaded, the binary version will be displayed.

    Press OK to proceed to setup "systemd" service.

- You will now be asked to enter a path for storing data. If you're unsure about the appropriate value, it's recommended to keep the default setting.

  <Tip>
    _The folder path should be directed to a disk with ample free space for
    storing the Sui Blockchain data._
  </Tip>

  ![Sui Wizard Data Folder Input](/node-setup/sui-wizard/assets/sui-wizard-data-folder-input.png)

- The last step is to start the Sui fullnode process, press `Yes` if you wish to start or `No` if you want to make some changes and manually start.
  ![Sui Wizard Restart Sui](/node-setup/sui-wizard/assets/sui-wizard-restart-sui.png)

- Once you start/restart your sui-node service, you can check the logs by running the following command:
  ```bash
  journalctl -fu sui-node
  ```
