title: Running A Sui Validator
description: "Steps to setup a Sui Validator on testnet"
---

The Steps to setup a Sui Validator are similar to that of running a Sui Fullnode

## System Requirements

These are the recommended requirements given during testnet wave phase.

- CPUs: 24 physical cores / 48 vCPUs
- RAM: 128 GB
- Storage (SSD): 2 TB NVMe drive

## Steps to Setup a Validator

<Tip>
  In this walkthough we are going to setup a validator for `Mainnet`, but the
  steps remain same for other Sui networks.
</Tip>

### Step 1: Connect to the Server

To connect to your server, use SSH or RDP to access the server terminal, allowing you to run commands directly.

### Step 2: Download and Run Sui Wizard

- Download the script

  ```bash
  curl --fail --location --output helper.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Scale3-Labs/sui-node-helper/master/helper.sh
  ```

- Give executable permissions

  ```bash
  chmod +x helper.sh
  ```

- Run the script

  <Note>
    _If the script prompts to install dependencies, type 'y' to install them._
  </Note>

  ```bash
  ./helper.sh
  ```

### Step 3: Configure the server for running Sui Mainnet Validator

- Once you are on the welcome screen, follow the screenshots below for the steps.
  Press `Yes`

- Read the instructions and press `Yes` to continue.
  ![Sui Wizard Navigation Instructions](/node-setup/sui-wizard/assets/sui-wizard-navigation-instructions.png)

- Since we are setting up a Validator, we will select the **Validator Node** option.

- Select **Setup Validator From Scratch**
  ![Sui Wizard Node Operations](/node-setup/sui-wizard/assets/sui-wizard-validator-node-operations.png)

- For the next screen, you are asked to choose Sui network, we will choose **Mainnet**.
  ![Sui Wizard Network Choice](/node-setup/sui-wizard/assets/sui-wizard-network-choice.png)

- On the next page there are two fields, you can keep it default.

1.  Release Version or hash

    This is the `sui-node` version that has to be installed. The values can be either:

    - **Github release**: sui-v1.0.0, testnet-1.0.0
    - **Branch**: mainnet, testnet, or devnet
    - **Commit Hash**: ae1212baf8f0837e25926d941db3d26a61c1bea2, c525ba6489261ff6db65e87bf9a3fdda0a6c7be3

    > Avoid using commit hash as much as possible, using **Github Release is the easiest and recommended option**.

2.  Absolute folder for configs

    Path to the folder where you want to store all your Sui node configs. Configs include `validator.yaml`, binaries, etc.

    <Tip>Make sure to remember this path for updating your node in future.</Tip>

    ![Sui Wizard Release Input Window](/node-setup/sui-wizard/assets/sui-wizard-release-input-window.png)

    After pressing `OK` or hitting enter/return, the download of the Sui binary will start, and once it's successfully downloaded, the binary version will be displayed.

- Next step is to setup validator config and keystore. This basically creates `client.yaml` file which will be used by Sui validator tool aka sui client to interact with Sui network.

  Once the client file is created, you will have an option to view and edit the file. **If you do not have any idea, just keep it default**.

  Press `tab` key to switch between edit text box and `OK` button.

- Take the note of `Wallet Recovery Phrase` for backup purposes. You can either take a screenshot or take a picture from your mobile.

- This is the step where you provide your validator info (metadata) to the Sui network. This details are shown on Sui explorer dashboards.

  1. Validator Name: This is your company/org or project name
  2. Description: Here you can provide more details on what your company does.
  3. Logo URL: Public URL for your company logo.
  4. Project URL: Company website URL.
  5. Host/IP: DNS name for Validator, or else Public IP of the Validator.
  6. Gas Price: Integer value of the gas price in MIST. To check the current gas price refer Sui explorer: https://suiexplorer.com/

  ![Sui Wizard Validator Info](/node-setup/sui-wizard/assets/sui-wizard-validator-info.png)

- Proceed to setting up Sui systemd service. You will now be asked to enter a path for storing data. If you're unsure about the appropriate value, it's recommended to keep the default setting.

  <Tip>
    _The folder path should be directed to a disk with ample free space for
    storing the Sui Blockchain data._
  </Tip>

  ![Sui Wizard Data Folder Input](/node-setup/sui-wizard/assets/sui-wizard-data-folder-input.png)

- Once the service setup is completed, to become the validator, at first you need to sign up as validator candidate, by selecting `Perform Validator Operations`.

  <Info>
    When requested, insert the Sui path that you added in "Absolute folder for
    configs" field during setup.
  </Info>

- Your next step is to get enough Sui tokens on the validator address.

- After validator address becomes a validator candidate and you have enough Sui tokens staked, you can make a request to network to become validator by selecting `Perform Validator Operations`.

  <Info>
    When requested, insert the Sui path that you added in "Absolute folder for
    configs" field during setup.
  </Info>
  ![Sui Wizard Validator Operations](/node-setup/sui-wizard/assets/sui-wizard-validator-operations.png)

- Any time you can start/stop/restart your validator process using the following command

  ```bash
  systemctl start sui-node
  systemctl stop sui-node
  systemctl restart sui-node
  ```

- Once you start/restart your sui-node service, you can check the logs by running the following command:
  ```bash
  journalctl -fu sui-node
  ```
