There are two methods for monitoring your node; agentless (pull method) and agent-based (push method).

<Card title="Push Method" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/monitoring/push-method">
  This requires the use of Grafana agent for pulling metrics from the target node. 
</Card>

<Card title="Pull Method" icon="link" href="/monitoring/pull-method">
  This method requires that your node metrics port is available to scrape from our backend. 
</Card>
<Tip>  NOTE: Pull Method is only available for Sui and ETH (Lighthouse & Geth) nodes. </Tip>
