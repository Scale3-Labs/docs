title: Monitor your ETH-Docker or any docker based node using Scale3 Autopilot
---

When running Docker for your ETH nodes, you need to follow these steps to add Scale3 Autopilot monitoring:

- You need to expose metrics port for your Execution and Consensus clients; [here](#metrics-port-for-supported-eth-clients)  is a table of clients and port mappings. Follow steps below to expose metrics port:
- Check your `COMPOSE_FILE` to determine what ports to expose

```shell
cd ~/eth-docker/ && cat .env | grep -e COMPOSE_FILE=

COMPOSE_FILE=nimbus-cl-only.yml:nethermind.yml:grafana.yml:grafana-shared.yml
```

- In the example above, the result is `nimbus` and `nethermind`. I need to modify those two client configurations to expose my metrics port to Scale3 Grafana agent.
- We need to add a line to expose the Nimbus metrics port

```shell
- "8008:8008" 
```

- Backup the nimbus config file before making any modifications

```shell
cp nimbus-cl-only.yml nimbus-cl-only.yml.bk
```

- Open the file using nano and navigate to the ports section

```shell
nano nimbus-cl-only.yml
```

- Add a line for exposing 8008 as shown below. Be sure the indentation lines up with existing entries

- Save the file using Ctrl + S then Ctrl + X to exit
- Verify the changes have taken effect

```shell
cat nimbus-cl-only.yml | grep -e "8008:8008"
```

- Repeat the same process for Nethermind or any client of choice. Pay attention to the metrics port and adjust accordingly
- Example below I will expose port `6060` by adding `“6060:6060”` under the ports:

- Next run `ethd up` to restart the containers and have the changes take effect
- You can verify the posts are now exposed by running

```shell
docker ps --format "{{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}" | grep consensus
docker ps --format "{{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}" | grep execution
```

## Metrics Port for Supported ETH clients

| Client | Metrics Port |
| --- | --- |
| Geth | 6060 |
| Nethermind | 6060 |
| LIghthouse | 5054 |
| Nimbus | 8008 |
