- For installation options, choose the Agent-based method as this offers you the most coverage for metrics. You can monitor disk space, CPU, and other metrics not usually covered by the sui node binary. The Lightweight approach also works if you prefer an agentless approach with limited metrics. That is covered here.

- The next screen has the 3-step process for installing the Grafana agent then start shipping metrics to your dashboard.

- Login to your node via ssh then run the curl command as shown in the screenshot. In this example, I will be downloading Scale3 CLI by running

```shell
curl -L -G --fail "https://web-backend.scale3production.com/cli/binary" --data-urlencode "email=demo@gmail.com" --data-urlencode "id=s3lkrtdpyqciwbzuketahjseht" | tar -xz
```


- Change permissions by running the chmod command in your terminal

```shell
chmod a+x installcli.sh
```

- Next, create the Grafana agent config file. Copy the command and paste it into your terminal. Example below

- Create an API key if you havent done so before by clicking the **Create API Key** button otherwise this can be skipped

- Run the final command

```shell
./installcli.sh -gk 0381c304-15d5-4dfc-8d10-adb60e2fb895
```

- Review the Grafana agent configuration file before we start shipping metrics, be sure to type **1** then enter to continue with the installation.
