description: This doc will help you setup NodeKeeper for Google Cloud Platform Account
---

NodeKeeper makes it easy to setup and maintain a standalone blockchain node on Google Cloud Platform. This guide will help you with the steps that you need to perform for NodeKeeper.

# Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud Platform Account
- A Google Cloud Project with billing enabled
- VPC Network with subnet in desired region where you want to deploy the node

# Create a Service Account Key

For NodeKeeper to be able to create and manage resources on your behalf, you must create a service account and download its key.

Follow the instructions to create a service account key for your project.

	<Tab title="GCP Console">
        1.  Select your desired GCP project and from the left hand menu go to IAM & Admin → Service Accounts
            Or just click on this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).
            ![GCP Open Service Accounts Page](/nodekeeper/assets/nodekeeper-gcp-sa-instructions-1.png)
        2.  Click `CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT` and fill up the details as following:

            - Service account name: `scale3-nodekeeper`
            - Service account ID: _This field should auto populate based on the name you provide._
            - Service account description: `Scale3 nodekeeper access to create and manage blockchain nodes.`

            Click create and continue to the next step.

        3.  On the next page, you have to grant permissions to the newly created service account. Assign the role `Compute Instance Admin (v1)` to the service account and select it. Click continue and you don't need to grant access so complete the process by clicking Done.

        4.  Now you need to create keys. On the service account UI, search for the newly created service account my searching for `scale3-nodekeeper` and click on the service account email.

            1. Go to keys tab and select Add key → create new key
            ![GCP Service Account Keys Tab](/nodekeeper/assets/nodekeeper-gcp-keys-tab.png)
            2. The key type should be JSON and click create, within few seconds it should start downloading the key.

    <Tab title="GCloud Cli">
        This step assumes that you have installed and configured gcloud cli on your machine. If not, please follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) to install and configure gcloud cli.
        1.  Setup required variable that will be used throughout the process
            ```bash
            SCALE3_GCP_PROJECT_ID=<GCP Project Id where you want to setup a node>
            ```
        2. Create a service account
            ```bash
            gcloud iam service-accounts create scale3-nodekeeper \
                --project=$SCALE3_GCP_PROJECT_ID \
                --description="Scale3 nodekeeper access to create and manage blockchain nodes." \
                --display-name="scale3-nodekeeper"
            ```
        3. Grant permissions to the service account
            ```bash
            gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $SCALE3_GCP_PROJECT_ID \
                --member="serviceAccount:scale3-nodekeeper@$SCALE3_GCP_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
                --role="roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1"
            ```
        4. Download service account key
            ```bash
            gcloud iam service-accounts keys create scale3-sa-key.json \
    	        --project=$SCALE3_GCP_PROJECT_ID \
                --iam-account=scale3-nodekeeper@$SCALE3_GCP_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
            ```
