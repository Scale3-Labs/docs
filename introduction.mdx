Whether you have a validator node or a full node, Scale3 provides you with a set of tools to help you manage your node and keep it healthy.

- If you already have a node, you can jump straight to the [Setup Alerts](#setup-alerts-for-your-validator-node) section.
- If you wish to setup a new node, you can follow the [Node Setup](#setup-and-run-a-validator-or-full-node) section to first get a node up and running. Then you can start with the [Setup Alerts](#setup-alerts-for-your-validator-node) section to setup alerts followed by the [Setup Monitoring](#setup-a-monitoring-dashboard-for-your-validator-node) section to setup a monitoring dashboard.
  > **Note**: Scale3 does not provide node hosting infrastructure. We have built an open source tool to help you set up a validator or a full node.

## Setup Alerts for your validator node

Setup alerts for your node health, validator metrics, node software releases and network events and be notified via email, slack or pagerduty.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Node health" icon="heart" href="/alerting/node-health">
    Get alerted when your node's CPU, memory or disk usage is high. Also get
    alerted when your node is down or has no peers.

## Setup a monitoring dashboard for your validator node

Setup a validator node monitoring dashboard by linking your validator node to our platform. The monitoring dashboard is a Grafana based dashboard which is completely managed by Scale3 so you do not have to worry about setting up and maintaining a prometheus-grafana infrastructure.

Currently, we provide two methods to link your validator node to our platform.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Agent based - Push (Recommended)"
    icon="arrows-rotate"
    href="/monitoring/push-method"
  >
    Installs the Grafana agent. Includes node & host metrics.
  </Card>
  <Card title="IP/URL based - Pull" icon="link" href="/monitoring/pull-method">
    Requires the RPC & Prometheus ports exposed. Includes only node metrics.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Setup and run a validator or full node

> **Note**: We currently support this only for the Sui blockchain. We will be adding support for other blockchains soon.

Setup a Sui validator/full node using our [open source tool](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/sui-node-helper) - Sui Node Wizard.

  <Card
    title="Sui Fullnode"
    icon="gear"
    iconType="regular"
    href="/node-setup/sui-wizard/running-a-sui-fullnode"
  >
    Setup a Sui Fullnode and use it for developing applications on the Sui
    blockchain.

  >
    Selected to run a Sui Validator? Follow the best practices to set it up
    efficiently.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Node Inventory Management

> **Note**: We currently support this only for the Sui, APTOS, ETH, SOL, NEAR, MATIC and AVAX. We will be adding support for other blockchains soon.

Do you run a cluster of nodes across different networks? Setup a single view dashboard for all your nodes and manage them efficiently.

## API Integrations

Would you like to integrate Scale3 with your existing tools? We provide a set of APIs to help you integrate our platform with your existing tools.
