## Setup a monitoring dashboard for your validator node

Setup a validator node monitoring dashboard by linking your validator node to our platform. The monitoring dashboard is a Grafana based dashboard which is completely managed by Scale3 so you do not have to worry about setting up and maintaining a prometheus-grafana infrastructure.
