Whether you have a validator node or a full node, Scale3 provides you with a set of tools to help you manage your node and keep it healthy.
* If you already have a node, you can jump straight to the [Setup Alerts](#setup-alerts-for-your-validator-node) section.
* If you wish to setup a new node, you can follow the [Node Setup](#setup-and-run-a-validator-or-full-node) section to first get a node up and running. Then you can start with the [Setup Alerts](#setup-alerts-for-your-validator-node) section to setup alerts followed by the [Setup Monitoring](#setup-a-monitoring-dashboard-for-your-validator-node) section to setup a monitoring dashboard. 
> **Note**: Scale3 does not provide node hosting infrastructure. We have built an open source tool to help you set up a validator or a full node.

## Setup Alerts for your validator node
Setup alerts for your node health, validator metrics, node software releases and network events and be notified via email, slack or pagerduty.

## Setup a monitoring dashboard for your validator node

Setup a validator node monitoring dashboard by linking your validator node to our platform. The monitoring dashboard is a Grafana based dashboard which is completely managed by Scale3 so you do not have to worry about setting up and maintaining a prometheus-grafana infrastructure.

Currently, we provide two methods to link your validator node to our platform.

    Installs the Grafana agent. Includes node & host metrics.

  <Card
    title="IP/URL based - Pull"
    icon="link"
    href="https://scale3labs.com/docs/node-monitoring/pull-method"

    Requires the RPC & Prometheus ports exposed. Includes only node metrics.

## Setup and run a validator or full node

> **Note**: We currently support this only for the SUI blockchain. We will be adding support for other blockchains soon.

Setup a SUI validator/full node using our [open source tool](https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/sui-node-helper) - Sui Node Wizard.
