We currently support the following FLOW network node types:

- Access Node
- Observer Node (Light Node)

<Info>
	Support of other node types is in progress. Please contact us if you need a
	specific node type.

Wondering what type of node to run for your needs? Checkout the decision tree [here](https://developers.flow.com/references/run-and-secure/nodes).

To know about them in detail heres the [documentation](https://developers.flow.com/references/run-and-secure/node-operation/node-roles).

# Requirements

## Hardware

Follow the document to know about the minimum hardware requirements for running a node of any type.

https://developers.flow.com/references/run-and-secure/node-operation/node-provisioning

## Tokens

Running a node requires you to stake a certain amount of tokens. The amount of tokens required depends on the type of node you are running. You can find the details [here](https://developers.flow.com/references/run-and-secure/node-operation/node-roles).

| Node Type    | Tokens Required |
| :----------- | --------------: |
| Access       |        100 FLOW |
| Observer     |               - |
| Collection   |    250,000 FLOW |
| Consensus    |    500,000 FLOW |
| Execution    |  1,250,000 FLOW |
| Verification |    135,000 FLOW |

# Access Node

To run an access node, it is recommended to have a minimum of **16GB RAM** and **4 CPU cores**. To store the blockchain data on the node, it is recommended to have atleast **750GB of disk** space.

<Note>
	Access nodes are required to stake **100 FLOW** to be a confirmed node
	operator. However, since an access node does not participate in block
	production, it does not receive any staking rewards.
</Note>

## Setup

Nodepilot will help with provisioning and configuring the node. It can also help you setup logging and monitoring for the node.

Your access not will not start **until you stake 100 FLOW tokens** on the node address.

## Staking

Follow the process mentioned in official documentation to setup and stake FLOW tokens using Flow Port.

Once you have followed Step 2 & Step 3, wait for the epoch that confirms your stake. You can check Flow Port for an ETA for your node whitelisting.

Once your node address is whitelisted, you can start your node by running the following command:

```bash
sudo service restart flow-go
```

Wait for few minutes, and your node should be up and start syncing with the network.

To check logs of your node, run the following command:

```bash
sudo journalctl -fu flow-go
```
