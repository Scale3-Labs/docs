Nodepilot makes it easy to setup and maintain a standalone blockchain node on Azure. This guide will help you with the steps that you need to perform for Nodepilot.

# Prerequisites

- An Azure account
- Azure Virtual Network setup with subnets in desired location

# Create Service Principal

For Nodepilot to be able to crete and manage resources on your Azure account, you need to .

You can create an access key by following the instructions.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Azure Console">

        1. Login to your Azure Account:
            Log in to your Azure account using the Azure portal: https://portal.azure.com/

        2. Create a Service Principal:

            - In the left-hand menu, select "Azure Active Directory".
            - Go to "App registrations" and click on "+ New registration".
            - Fill in the necessary details for your application, such as the name.
            - Under "Supported account types", choose the appropriate option based on your use case.

        3. Create a Client Secret:

            - After creating the app registration, go to the "Certificates & secrets" section.
            - Under the "Client secrets" section, click on "+ New client secret".
            - Add a description, choose an expiration (or leave it never-expiring), and click "Add".

        4. Assign Role (Permissions) to Service Principal:

            - Once the client secret is created, go to the Azure resource (like a resource group or specific resource) you want your application to have access to.
            - In the resource's "Access control (IAM)" section, click on "+ Add role assignment".
            - Choose a role that corresponds to the permissions you need. The "Contributor" role is commonly used for managing resources.

        5.  Select a Principal:

            - In the "Add role assignment" window, under "Assign access to", choose "User, group, or service principal".
            - In the "Select" box, search for and select the app registration (service principal) you created.

        6.  Access Secrets in Your Application:

            - In your application or script, you will use the Service Principal's Application ID (Client ID) and the Client Secret to authenticate.
            - Use these credentials to authenticate with Azure services like Azure Resource Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Azure Cli">
        This step assumes that you have installed and configured Azure CLI on your machine. If not, you can follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).


        1.  List Subscriptions
            ```bash
            az account list
            ```
            Here, you may see multiple subscriptions, select the one that you want to use for Nodepilot. Copy the subscription ID to be used in the next step.
        2. Set the Subscription
            ```bash
            az account set --subscription="<Subscription ID>"
            ```
        3. Create Service Principal
            ```bash
            az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>"
            ```
            Here, we are giving contibutor access, but you can restrict the access just to desired services.
        4. Copy `appId`, `password` and `tenant` from the output and keep it safe. You will need it later.
