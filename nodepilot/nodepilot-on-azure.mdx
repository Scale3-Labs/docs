        2. Set the Subscription
            ```bash
            az account set --subscription="<Subscription ID>"
            ```
        3. Create Service Principal
            ```bash
            az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>"
            ```
            Here, we are giving contibutor access, but you can restrict the access just to desired services.
