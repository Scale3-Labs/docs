Nodepilot makes it easy to setup and maintain a standalone blockchain node on Azure. This guide will help you with the steps that you need to perform for Nodepilot.

# Prerequisites

- An Azure account
- Azure Virtual Network setup with subnets in desired location

# Create Service Principal

For Nodepilot to be able to crete and manage resources on your Azure account, you need to .

You can create an access key by following the instructions.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Azure Console">

        1. Login to your Azure Account:
            Log in to your Azure account using the Azure portal: https://portal.azure.com/

        2. Create a Service Principal:

            - In the left-hand menu, select "Azure Active Directory".
            - Go to "App registrations" and click on "+ New registration".
            - Fill in the necessary details for your application, such as the name.
            - Under "Supported account types", choose "Accounts in this organizational directory only (Default Directory only - Single tenant)"
            - Click "Register" to create the app registration.

        3. Create a Client Secret:

            - After creating the app registration, go to the "Certificates & secrets" section on the left.
            - Under the "Client secrets" section, click on "+ New client secret".
            - Add a description, choose an expiration, and click "Add".

        4. Assign Role (Permissions) to Service Principal:

            - Once the client secret is created, go to the Azure resource group you want your application to have access to.
            If you don't have a Resource Group, create one on the Azure portal [here](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.ResourceGroup). Note down the Resource Group name, Subscription Name and Region.
            - In the resource group's "Access control (IAM)" section, click on "Add role assignment".
            - In "Priviledged administrator roles" tab, select "Contributor" role, click next.
            - Select members, search for the app registration (service principal) you created, and review and assign.

        5. Copy `appId`, `password` and `tenant` from the output and keep it safe. You will need it later.

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Azure Cli">
        This step assumes that you have installed and configured Azure CLI on your machine. If not, you can follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).


        1.  List Subscriptions
            ```bash
            az account list
            ```
            Here, you may see multiple subscriptions, select the one that you want to use for Nodepilot. Copy the subscription ID to be used in the next step.
        2. Set the Subscription
            ```bash
            az account set --subscription="<Subscription ID>"
            ```
        3. Create Service Principal
            ```bash
            az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>"
            ```
            Here, we are giving contibutor access, but you can restrict the access just to desired services.
        4. Copy `appId`, `password` and `tenant` from the output and keep it safe. You will need it later.
